Translation are `.yml` files, containing nested structures. Path masks are
defined in application's `bundle.yml` configs.

All files are joined together and "flattened":

- translation keys are combined as: "path.to.folder." + "nested.key.name"
- if value string starts with `md:`, it's processed with markdowm:
  - `foo: "md: that's a [link](/foo/bar)`.
- if any key in `.yml` file prefixed with `=`, content is considered as object,
  not as string:
  - `=foo: [ 'bar, baz' ]`.

Phrases are processed with [babelfish](https://github.com/nodeca/babelfish/).

### Helpers

- `env.t()` and `self.t()` (in templates) accept relative paths (relative to
  current folder.
- if you need "absolute" name - add `@` to start:
  - `env.t('@foo.bar', params)`
- to make relative paths work in templates, render subtemplates only with
  `self.partial()` helper.
