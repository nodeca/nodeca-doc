Translation are `.yml` files, containing nested structures. Path masks are
defined in application's `bundle.yml` configs.

All files are joined together and "flattened":

- translation keys are combined as: "path.to.folder." + "nested.key.name"
- if value string starts with `md:`, it's processed with markdowm:
  - `foo: "md: that's a [link](/foo/bar)`.
- if any key in `.yml` file prefixed with `=`, content is considered as object,
  not as string:
  - `=foo: [ 'bar, baz' ]`.

Phrases are processed with [babelfish](https://github.com/nodeca/babelfish/).

## Helpers

### Translations

- `env.t()` and `self.t()` (in templates) accept relative paths (relative to
  current folder.
- if you need "absolute" name - add `@` to start:
  - `env.t('@foo.bar', params)`
- to make relative paths work in templates, render subtemplates only with
  `self.partial()` helper.

### Dates

Templates have `self.date(time, formatName)` helper, which supports localized
time in different formats. Currently configured formats are:

- `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `compact`, `relative`. See
  [definition](https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca.core/blob/master/config/locales/l10n.en.yml).
- By default 'relative' format will be used.
- For available "subintervals" for relative time configuration see
  [DateFormatter](https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca.core/blob/master/lib/system/date_formatter.js) src.
