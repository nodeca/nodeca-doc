Menus are special feature, to define static navigation lists, and easily check
access permissions. You can make as many menus as you wish. Menus can be merged
from different applications.

For client-side, menu configuration is bundled on namespace basis (just like
translations) and available as static JSON file. On server-side it's avilable
as `N.config.menus` subtree.

`N.runtime.router` is used to build links for menu items.


Configuration
-------------

```
--- # Definitions: ./config/menus.yml
menus:
  common:                         # app namespace (see docs/application.md for details on namespaces)
    topnav:                       # menu id
      profile:                    # menu item
        to: user.profile          # server method (optional)
        priority: 100             # item priority (optional. default: 100)
        check_permissions: true   # check action permissions to show/hide item (optional. default: false.)

Rendering Menus
---------------

_nodeca.core_ registers two special _after_ action filter that exposes a
permission map into `env.response.menu_permissions` for _common_ and current
namespaces (first-level menu ids). Example:

``` javascript
{
  "forum.post.create": false,
  "forum.post.view": true
}
```

Also it provides `common.get_permissions_map` server method which can be used
to get the same object:

```
nodeca.server.common.menu_permissions(params, callback) -> Void
- params (Object):
- callback (Function):

### params

- **menu_ids** (Array)
```

Shared method that generates a menu map by menu id and permission map:

```
nodeca.shared.get_menus(menu_id, permissions_map) -> Object
- menu_ids (Array):
- permissions_map (Object):
```

which returns structure like the on below:

``` javascript
{
  common: {
    topnav: [
      {
        title: "Profile",
        link: "http://nodeca.org/user/profile"
      },
      // ...
    ]
  },

  admin: {
    "system-sidebar": [
      {
        title: "Tools & Settings",
        childs: [
          {
            title: "System Settings",
            link: "http://nodeca.org/admin/settings",
            childs: [
              {
                title: "Performance Mode",
                link: "http://nodeca.org/admin/performance"
              },
              // ...
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Before rendring views (on server/client), we are using this shared method
to build all menu maps and expose it:

- as `env.response.data.menus` on server
- as `locals.menus` on client
