# Themes whitelist/blacklist

# You can specify either whitelist:
#
#   themes:
#     enabled:
#       - deep-purple
#       - pink-floyd
#
# or blacklist of enabled themes:
#
#   themes:
#     disabled:
#       - yellow-submarine
#
# All available themes are enabled by default, when no whitelist or blacklist
# specified. When both white and black lists are provided, whitelist is used.
